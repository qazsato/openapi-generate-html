# openapi-static-html

Generate inline HTML documentation from OpenAPI spec.

## Feature

1. ðŸ“— Single HTML File
2. ðŸŒ™ Use Dark Theme

One of the key benefits of `openapi-static-html` is its portability. By generating a single, self-contained HTML file, all required assets (CSS, JavaScript, and OpenAPI data) are embedded directly in the document. This makes it easy to:

1. **Share** the file as a single, standalone document without additional dependencies.
2. **Host** the file on any server or serve it locally, with no need for additional resources or configurations.
3. **Distribute** the file via email or other methods, knowing that it will display consistently across environments.

This portability makes `openapi-static-html` ideal for situations where reliable, standalone documentation is required.

## How to use

```bash
npx openapi-static-html -i openapi.json
```
